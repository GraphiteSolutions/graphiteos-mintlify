# Profile Creation for Talent User

In GraphiteOS, Talent users—also referred to as candidates—can self-sign up directly from the website. However, their profiles must be approved by an admin before they can access projects.

## Self Sign-Up

1. Access the URL - [https://www.graphite.com/](https://www.graphite.com/). The landing page is displayed with multiple call-to-actions, including **Login**, **Request a Call**, and **Join as an Independent Expert**.

2. Click **Join as an Independent Expert**.

3. Enter your **Email address** and **Password** according to the displayed criteria.

4. Once the password meets the criteria, the **Save & Continue** button becomes enabled. Click **Save & Continue**.

5. On the next screen, select your preferred availability: **Full-time**, **Part-time**, or **In between jobs**.

6. Click **Save & Continue**. The **Import Profile Data** page is displayed.

7. On the Import Profile Data page, upload your resume in **PDF format** (max size: **2 MB**).

8. Click **Save & Continue**. You will see a message:  

   \> "Analyzing your data to complete your profile."

9. The system parses your resume and auto-fills key profile fields.

10. Review the pre-filled fields and complete any missing information manually.

11. Submit your application to join the network. Your status will show as **Pending Approval**.

## Admin: Adding a New Talent

In the **GraphiteOS Admin Console**, an agency admin has two options to create a new candidate:

- **Invite Active Candidate**

- **Import Passive Candidate**

### Option 1: Invite Candidate (Active Candidate)

Use the **Invite Candidate** flow to add candidates with **Active** status.

To invite an active candidate:

1. From the **Admin Console**, click **Create New Candidate \> Invite Candidate**.

2. The **Invite New Candidate to Join** dialog box is displayed.

3. Enter the candidate’s **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email Address**.

4. The **Message** textbox contains a pre-filled message, which you can customize as needed.

5. Click **Send Invite**.

6. A pop-up message appears at the top of the page:  

   \> "Successfully sent expert invite to \<candidate’s email address\>."

The candidate can use the URL in the email to access the GraphiteOS platform.

#### What Happens Next

| Action                   | System Action                                        | Email Notification                      |

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

| Invite is sent           | Candidate receives email with a "Join Now" link     | "You've been invited to join Graphite"  |

| Candidate signs up       | Candidate fills out profile and enters Pending Approval state | "Thanks for applying"           |

| Admin approves the candidate | Candidate is admitted to the network and gains full access | "Welcome to the network"         |

### Option 2: Import Passive Candidate

Use the **Import Candidate** flow to create a candidate profile using their resume, without requiring immediate participation from them. This is ideal when sourcing or proactively building a pipeline.

\> **Note:** Use this option only if you have **explicit consent** from the candidate.

To import a passive candidate:

1. From the **Admin Console**, click **Create New Candidate \> Invite Candidate**. Two options are displayed.

2. Select **Import Candidate**. The **Import Passive Candidate** dialog box is displayed.

3. Enter the **Email Address**.

4. Drag and drop or upload the resume in **PDF format** (Max size: **2 MB**).

5. Click **Import**. A popup message is displayed:  

   \> "Successfully imported the user with \<email address\>"

#### What Happens Next

| Action               | System Action                                    | Email Notification                          |

|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

| Resume is uploaded   | System parses resume and generates a draft profile | No email                                    |

| Candidate is visible to Admins | Candidate remains inactive until reviewed and activated | No email                            |

| Admin activates the candidate | Candidate becomes part of the active network | "Welcome to the network" (if triggered)     |
